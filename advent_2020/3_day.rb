# With the toboggan login problems resolved, you set off toward the airport. While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.
#
# Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (.) and trees (#) you can see. For example:
#
# ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
# #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..

# You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).
#
# The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:
#
# From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.
